## Introduction to Python Graphics using Turtle

“Turtle” is a python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it!
You can install it using the following command `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.

You can use functions like turtle.forward(...) and turtle.left(...) which can move the turtle around.

Here are some of the commands that you can use:

| Turtle Function  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  turtle.left(x) | turns left by x pixels |
| turtle.right(x)  | turns right by x pixels  |
|  turtle.forward(x) | moves forward by x pixels |
| turtle.backward(x)  | moves backward by x pixels  |
|  turtle.goto(x,y) | repositions to the location `x,y` in the drawing board |
| turtle.color("color")  | changes the color from black to "color"  |

Remember `x` is a integer/float value in pixels.  

Before you can use turtle, you have to import it.
